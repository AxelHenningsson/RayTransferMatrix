# RayTransferMatrix
This library is a simple implementation of the Ray Transfer Matrix (RTM) theory for the case of a Compound Refractive Lens (CRL). This library represents a collection of script that is aimed at understanding the theory behind CRL focusing lengths, back-focal plane transformations, as well as the downstream imaging plane.
